                <li class="food-1">First time trying this and YOU have to go! It’s the cutest little spot with amazing food. The food is to die for. IT WAS FIRE!!<br> The service we received was so amazing and we will definitely be back again. They made us feel welcomed and gave us an <br>amazing experience.</li>
                <li class="food-2">This place is great! Atmosphere is chill and cool but the staff is also really friendly. They know what they’re doing and what<br> they’re talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy is their main priority. Food is pretty good, some italian <br>classics and some twists, and for their prices it’s 100% worth it.</li>
                <li class="food-1"> Do yourself a favor and visit this lovely restaurant in LB nagar. The service is unmatched. The staff truly cares about your experience.<br> The food is absolutely amazing – everything we tasted melted in other mouths. Absolutely the best meal we had while in Hyderabad. <br>Highly recommend!</li>
                <li class="food-2">Excellent food. Menu is extensive and seasonal to a particularly high standard. Definitely fine dining. It can be expensive but worth it <br>and they do different deals on different nights so it’s worth checking them out before you book. Highly recommended.</li>
